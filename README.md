# Cookbot
I ueed to write notes on my Gitbook, and since I'm a law school student before, I write a lot. So it become a little diffcult for me to find the note I want. That's why I start this project.
<br>
<br>
I created a database and a API about my notes, then I created a chatbot to connect the API. So when I need to find notes, instead of going to Gitbook, I just give keyword to the chatbot via Messenger, then it'll do the searching and return results for me.

## Basic usages
- Type any text to Cookbot via Messenger.
- Cookbot will search in my Gitbook then response.
- Can checkout detail on my Gitbook or call the author of the Gitbook page via the bottons Cookbot sent.
